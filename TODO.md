# LinkMap Future Scope

This file outlines the planned future enhancements for the LinkMap project.

## High-Impact Improvements

-   **[ ] Performance Optimization:**
    -   Compress all image assets in `assets/images/` (e.g., `background.jpg`, `profile.jpg`) to reduce page load times.

-   **[ ] Semantic HTML:**
    -   Refactor the profile picture from a `div` with a background image to a proper `<img>` tag.
    -   Ensure the `<img>` tag includes a descriptive `alt` attribute for better SEO and accessibility.

## Feature Enhancements

-   **[ ] Animated Entrances:**
    -   Implement a subtle entrance animation for the link buttons (e.g., fade-in or slide-up).
    -   The animation should trigger sequentially as the page loads to create a dynamic effect.

-   **[ ] More Button Styles:**
    -   Design and implement new button style options, such as "glassmorphism" or gradient styles.
    -   Add the new styles as skin options in the `_config.yml`.

## Code and Maintainability

-   **[ ] Improved Documentation:**
    -   Enhance the `README.md` with a detailed guide on how to create and customize new skins.
    -   Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with guidelines for other developers who may want to contribute to the project.
